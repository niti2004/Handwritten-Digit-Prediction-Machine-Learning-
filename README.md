# Handwritten-Digit-Prediction-Machine-Learning-
The objective of this project is to build and train a neural network that can accurately recognize handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The model is trained using the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.
