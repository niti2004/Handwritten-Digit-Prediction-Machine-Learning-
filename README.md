# Handwritten-Digit-Prediction-Machine-Learning-
The objective of this project is to build and train a neural network that can accurately recognize handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The model is trained using the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.
Features
Data Preprocessing: Normalization of image data for better training performance.
Model Building: Construction of a simple neural network with an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer.
Model Training: Training the neural network on the MNIST dataset.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy on test data.
Prediction and Visualization: Making predictions on test data and visualizing the results.
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
